# Open-Google-Results
This python program opens top ten search links for any thing that you search in google. The number of links to be opened in new tabs can be changed in the program. 
The idea is to simply automate the online search procedure for the user. The user has to enter the name of the program and the keywords of the item he/she wants to search in the command line and then the top ten search results will open automatically.
